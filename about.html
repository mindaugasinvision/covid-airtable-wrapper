        <p>A bunch of us are now working from home and also trying to work with the basic ingredients that we have.</p>
        <p>There's also lots of chefs currently out of work with no idea when they'll be able to work again.</p>
        <pLet's try support these people by booking a virtual dining experience.</p>
        <p>It's also an experience while we're unable to leave our homes while at the same time puts some money in the pockets of those less fortunate.</p>
