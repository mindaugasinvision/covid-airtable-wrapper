        <p>A bunch of us are now working from home and renovating our environments (and writing blog posts about it).</p>
        <p>There's also lots of people who rely on face-to-face meetings with buyers, markets and shops selling their goods. They're self-employed and losing masses of income due to COVID-19.</p>
        <p>As with all local and small businesses like <a href="https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/1239622682225692672">Hair stylists, massage therapists, cleaners and nannies</a> we should still be supporting them.</p>
        <p>So how about we all buy something new for a wall or a shelf and keep some money in the pockets of the people that are feeling the squeeze.</p>
